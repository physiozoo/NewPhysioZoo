# mhrv

`mhrv` is a matlab toolbox for calculating Heart-Rate Variability (HRV) metrics
from both ECG signals and RR-interval time series. The toolbox works with ECG
data in the [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/) [1] WFDB data format.

## Features

- **WFDB wrappers and helpers**. A small subset of the PhysioNet WFDB tools are
  wrapped with matlab functions, to allow using them directly from matlab. For
  example,
    * `mhrv.wfdb.gqrs` - A QRS detection algorithm.
    * `mhrv.wfdb.rdsamp` - For reading PhysioNet signal data into matlab.
    * `mhrv.wfdb.rdann` - For reading PhysioNet annotation data into matlab.
    * `mhrv.wfdb.wrann` - For writing PhysioNet annotation data from matlab datatypes.
    * `mhrv.wfdb.wfdb_header` - Read record metadata from a WFDB header file (`.hea`).

- **ECG signal processing**. Peak detection and RR interval extraction from ECG data
  in PhysioNet format. For example,
    * `mhrv.wfdb.rqrs` - Detection of R-peaks in ECG signals (based on PhysioNet's
      `gqrs`). Configurable for use with both human and animal ECGs.
    * `mhrv.ecg.jqrs`/`mhrv.ecg.wjqrs` - An ECG peak-detector based on a modified Pan & Tompkins
      algorithm and a windowed version.
    * `mhrv.ecg.bpfilt`- Bandpass filtering for removing noise artifacts from ECG
      signals.
    * `mhrv.wfdb.ecgrr` - Construction of RR intervals from ECG data in PhysioNet format.
    * `mhrv.wfdb.qrs_compare` - Comparison of QRS detections to reference annotations and
      calculation of quality measures like Sensitivity, PPV.

- **RR-intervals signal processing**. Ectopic beat rejection, frequency filtering,
  nonlinear dynamic and fractal analysis. For example,
    * `mhrv.rri.filtrr` - Filtering of RR interval time series to detect ectopic (out of
      place) beats.
    * `mhrv.rri.dfa` - Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, a method of estimating the fractal
      scaling exponent of a signal [3].
    * `mhrv.rri.mse` - Multiscale Sample Entropy, a measure of the complexity of the
      signal computed on multiple time scales [4].
    * `mhrv.rri.sample_entropy` - Sample Entropy, a measure of the irregularity of a signal.

* HRV Metrics: Calculating quantitative measures that indicate the activity of
    the heart based on RR intervals using all standard HRV metrics defined in
    the literature (see e.g. [2]).
    * `mhrv.hrv.hrv_time` - Time Domain: AVNN, SDNN, RMSSD, pNNx.
    * `mhrv.hrv.hrv_freq` - Frequency Domain:
        * Total and normalized power in (configurable) VLF, LF, HF and custom
          user-defined bands.
        * Spectral power estimation using Lomb, Auto Regressive, Welch and FFT methods.
        * Additional frequency-domain features: LF/HF ratio, LF and HF peak
          frequencies, power-law scaling exponent (beta).
    * `mhrv.hrv.hrv_nonlinear` - Nonlinear methods:
        * Short- and long-term scaling exponents (alpha1, alpha2) based on DFA.
        * Sample Entropy and Multiscale sample entropy (MSE).
        * PoincarÃ© plot metrics (SD1, SD2).
    * `mhrv.hrv.hrv_fragmentation` - Time-domain RR interval fragmentation analysis [5].

* Configuration: The toolbox is fully configurable with many user-adjustable
  parameters.
    * The configuration files are in human-readable YAML format which
      is easy to edit and extend.
    * The user can create custom configurations files based on the
      `defatuls.yml` file (only overriding what's required).
    * Custom configuration files can be loaded with a single call which updates
      the defaults for the entire toolbox. This allows simple, reproducible
      analysis of different datasets that require different analysis
      configurations. See the `mhrv.defaults` package.
    * The settings for any of the functions can either be configured globally
      with configuration `yml` files or on a per-call basis with matlab-style
      key-value argument pairs.

* Plotting: All toolbox functions support plotting their output for data
  visualization. The plotting code is separated from the algorithmic code in
  order to simplify embedding this toolbox in other matlab applications.
  See the `mhrv.plots` package.

* Top-level analysis functions: These functions work with PhysioNet records and
  allow streamlined HRV analysis by composing the functions of this toolbox.
    * `mhrv.mhrv` - Analyzes a single PhysioNet record (ECG data or annotations),
      optionally split into multiple analysis windows.  Extracts all
      supported HRV features and optionally generates plots.
    * `mhrv.mhrv_batch` - Analyzes many PhysioNet records (ECG data or annotations) which
      can be further separated into user-defined groups (e.g. Control, Test).
      Automatically computes HRV metrics per group and generates a comparative
      summary of the HRV features in each group.

## Requirements

* Matlab with Signal Processing toolbox. Should work on Matlab R2014b or newer.
* The [PhysioNet WFDB tools](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml).
  The toolbox can install this for you.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo or download the source code.

2. From MATLAB, run the `mhrv_init` function. This function will:

    * Check for the presence of the WFDB tools in your system `PATH`. If WFDB
      tools are not detected, it will attempt to automatically download them for
      you into the folder `bin/wfdb` under the repository root.
    * Set up your MATLAB path to include the code from this toolbox.

### Manual WFDB Installation (Optional)

The above steps should be enough to get most users started. If however you
don't want `mhrv_init` to download the WFDB tools for you, or the automatic
installation fails for some reason, you can install them yourself.

  * On OSX, you can use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) to install it easily with
      `brew install wfdb`.
  * On Windows and Linux, you should either [download the WFDB
      binaries](https://physionet.org/physiotools/binaries/)
      for your OS or compile them [from
      source](https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml#downloading)
      using the instructions on their website.

Once you have the binaries, place them in some folder on your `$PATH` or
somewere under the repo's root folder (`bin/wfdb` would be a good choice as it's
`.gitignore`d) and they will be found and used automatically. Or, if you would
like to manually specify a path outside the repo which contains the WFDB
binaries (e.g. `/usr/local/bin` for a homebrew install), you can edit
[`cfg/defaults.yml`](https://github.com/avivrosenberg/mhrv/blob/master/cfg/defaults.yml)
and set the `mhrv.paths.wfdb_path` variable to the desired path.

For linux users it's recommended to install from source as the binaries provided
on the PhysioNet website are very outdated.

```

The `window_minutes` parameter allow splitting the signal into windows and
calculating all metrics per window. You can pass in an empty array `[]` to
disable spliting.

## Citing

This toolbox, initially called `rhrv`, was created as part of my MSc research
thesis. It was then renamed and updated to be used  as the basis of the
[PhysioZoo](https://physiozoo.github.io) platform for HRV analysis of human and
animal data.
