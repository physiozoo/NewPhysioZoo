Introduction
************

**PhysioZoo** is a collaborative platform dedicated to the study of the heart
rate variability (HRV) from Humans and other mammals’ electrophysiological
recordings. The main components of the platform are:

- *Software*

  - An open-source algorithmic toolbox for matlab (``mhrv``), which implements
    all standard HRV analysis algorithms, a selection of peak detection
    algorithms and prefiltering routines. This can be used within your own data
    analysis code using the ``mhrv`` API.
    
  - An open-source graphical user interface (``PZ-UI``) that provides a user
    friendly interface for advanced HRV analysis of RR-intervals time series and
    data visualization tools. This enables easy access to HRV analysis without
    writing any code.

- *Databases*

  - A set of annotated databases (``PZ-DB``) of electrophysiological signals
    from different mammals (dog, rabbit and mouse). Available `here
    <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1waDbfJlCWLGWTfaV7_tJ1j2-4Re5N5OG/view?usp=sharing>`_.

  - Manually audited peak locations and signal quality annotations for each of
    the recordings.


- *Configuration*
  
  - A set of configuration files that adapt the HRV measures and ``mhrv``
    algorithms to work with data from different mammals.
    
  - All HRV measures can be further adapted for the analysis of other mammals by
    creating simple human-readable mammal-specific configuration files.

.. Note::

    The ``PZ-UI`` user interface has two modules: a ``Peak detection``
    (used to process electrophysiological signals and obtain the RR time series)
    module and a ``HRV analysis`` module (used to process the RR time series and
    compute HRV measures).


The **PhysioZoo** mission is to standardize and enable the reproducibility of
HRV analysis in mammals’ electrophysiological data. This is achieved through its
open source code, freely available user interface and open access databases. It
also aims to encourage the scientific community to contribute their
electrophysiological databases and novel HRV algorithms/analysis tools for
advancing the research in the field.
